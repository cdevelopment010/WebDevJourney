# Sass crash course by Dev Ed

Tutorial about Sass from Dev Ed [video is here](https://youtu.be/Zz6eOVaaelI)


## Overview
This was a good introduction using partials, variables, mixins and extends. 

I didn't use the sass extension in VSCode, but used sass from `npm install sass`

Also, rather than use @import, I opted to for @use.
